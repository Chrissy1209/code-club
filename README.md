# <Strong>_Problems of this week_</Strong>

1. Implement a BST(using linked list), input an unsorted array using BST to output the sorted array
   the BST object needs these methods:
    
    1. insert(data)
    2. getRoot() //return root (for some method below)
    3. findMin() // return minimum
    4. findMax() // return Maximum
    5. inOrder(root) // return inOrder result
    6. search(root,data) //return 'Found it' or 'Not found'

   Input:<br  />
      [3, 78, 23, 5, 768, 234, 122, 456, 33, 234, 6745, 7, 15, 9, 0]<br  />

   output:<br  />
      Before sorting : 3,78,23,5,768,234,122,456,33,234,6745,7,15,9,0<br  />
      After sorting : 0,3,5,7,9,15,23,33,78,122,234,234,456,768,6745<br  />
      MAX is : 6745<br  />
      min is : 0<br  />
      Search for 122 : Found it<br  />
      Search for 3343 : Not found<br  />

# <Strong>_Rules_</Strong>

1. You do not talk about Code-club.

2. There is no correct answer, only have the better answer, so don't scold others

3. If you encounter difficulties, you can discuss with the people at code-club, but don’t read the answer directly before finishing it.

4. No pressure, not mandatory, But if you don't come this week you must tell the group first

5. Don't mess with other people's folders, I can see

    Unified format)

-   git commit -m `"the date you finish your code"`

-   Try your best to solve the weekly problems, otherwise it will accumulate more and more and cause self-confidence to be frustrated.
